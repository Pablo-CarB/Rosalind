# Rosalind
 
this repository is a way for me to store solutions to Rosalind problems, a kind of leetcode type website for bionformatics problems that can be found at https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/

Each folder is meant to hold the solution code to the problem with the folder's name, there will also likely be a .txt or .fasta file in the folder as well this is just because the way Rosalind works it gives you the inputs to whatever code you are writing as a file and likewise expects the answer as a file.
